## Features

1. Prompts: The app prompts questions to the user for information about the SVG logo, guiding the user through the SVG logo creation process.

2. Structure: The application ensures that the logo file follows the SVG structure. Sections are organized according to text, text color , shape and shape color.

3. Shape options: The generator allows the user to choose a shape for the logo from the list of choices (circle, triangle, or square). It prompts the user to input a color for the shape, and then it adds the corresponding shape and color to the SVG logo file.

4. Text options: The generator allows the user to input a text of 3 or less characters for the logo as well as a color, and then it adds the corresponding text and color on top of the shape displayed in the SVG logo file when viewed in the browser.


5. View Logo: Once all prompted questions are answered, a new "logo.SVG" file will be created with the returned data. The user can open the file in a browser to be viewed the newly created svg logo image.

## Usage
Go Logo is ideal for any developers who want to create a professional logo or shape.
